This repo contains a set of modules to install a kubernetes cluster in your own AWS environment.
More information on each module can be found here:

- [controller module](modules/controllers/): Spin up a single master to be used as control plane
- [cri module](modules/cri/): Modules to choose which container engine to use
    - [containerd module](modules/controllers/containerd)
    - [cri-o module](modules/controllers/cri-o)
    - [docker module](modules/controllers/docker)
- [nodes module](modules/nodes/): Spin up a set of nodes to act as nodes for the cluster

This module is not intended to be used for production workload.

At the moment I wanted to avid dependencies to external tools like ansible, so the installation happens in bash with
cloud-init. This means some architectural choices are defined in there, and they can't be modified.

Obviously this can be fixed, just fork and PR into this :)
